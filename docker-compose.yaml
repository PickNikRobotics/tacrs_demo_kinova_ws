        # 2. Replace the 'nvidia-driver-555' apt package with the Nvidia driver version on your host, e.g. nvidia-driver-535, nvidia-driver-555. Use nvidia-smi on your host to determine the driver version.
        # After rebuilding via `moveit_pro build` verify the drivers are active in your container by running `nvidia_smi` inside of `moveit_pro shell`.
